# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

In this analysis we utilized PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to help the management team at Pewlett-Hackard to better prepare for the upcoming retirement wave also referred to as the "silver tsunami." To help management the first goal was to retrieve the number of retiring employees by title, and then retrieve the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program.
